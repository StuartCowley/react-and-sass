## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Steps

### Project setup

#### Add `node-sass`

After creating project with CRA add `node-sass` to the project by running the command:

for npm
`npm install node-sass`

for yarn
`yarn add node-sass`

Now you can start development mode with standards Create React App commands.

#### Add Sass directory

1. Create dir `styles` in `src`.
2. Create `index.scss` file in `styles`.
3. Import `index.scss` in `index.js`:
   `import './src/styles/index.scss';`
4. To test Sass add any style to `./src/styles/index.scss`, for instance:

```
body {
  background-image: red;
}
```

#### Possible issues:

If the application crashes after linking Sass file in `index.js` with an error `Error: Node Sass version X.X.X is incompatible with ^X.X.X`, for instance: `Error: Node Sass version 5.0.0 is incompatible with ^4.0.0` you should uninstall `node-sass` and install it appropriate version of this module.

1. Check your node version by running the command:
   `node -v`.
2. Uninstall `node-sass`
   `npm uninstall node-sass`
   then install it again with the right (replace X.X with version number):
   `npm install node-sass@X.X`
   You can read more about the issue and find information which `node-sass` version is compatible with your `node` version [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64625050/error-node-sass-version-5-0-0-is-incompatible-with-4-0-0)
